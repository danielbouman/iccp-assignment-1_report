\section{Introduction}
The behaviour of argon is simulated using the molecular dynamics method. Python is used as programming language. For the interaction between the argon particles a Lennard-Jones potential

\begin{gather}
U(r) = 4\epsilon \left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^12-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right]
\end{gather}
is used, which corresponds well with experimental results for large ranges of parameters\cite{LJpotentialArgonverification}. For convenience all physical quantities are expressed in reduced units, such that $m=1$, $\epsilon = 1$ and $\sigma = 1$. 



$k_B=1$ $\rho=N/V$.
