\section{Equilibrium}
Scaling factor $\lambda$:
\begin{gather}\label{eq:rescale}
    \lambda=\sqrt{\frac{(N-1)3k_BT_D}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} mv_i^{2}}}.
\end{gather}
A simulation with 108 particles was run, figure %\ref{fig:instant_temp}
shows the instantaneous temperature as a function of time steps. The desired temperature was set to 300~K. The temperature fluctuates a lot at the start of the simulation, since the system is far from equilibrium. After around 1000 time steps the system appears to reach equilibrium and the temperature fluctuates around $T_D$. During the equilibration phase the particle velocity is rescaled at intervals of 200 time steps, with the rescaling factor from Eq. \ref{eq:rescale}. Now that the systme is in equilibrium, physical
