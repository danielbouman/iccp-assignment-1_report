\section{Initialization}
The number of particles $N$ is given by $4M^3$, where $M$ is the number of unit cells per dimension. The particles are then placed in the unit cell using a fcc Bravais lattice structure, with lattice constant $a=L/M$. Using the density $\rho$ and $N$, the size of the volume $V$ is determined and filled with the unit cells. Overlapping particles are avoided, by filling each unit cell with only the lower left 4 particles, as shown in figure \ref{fig:unit_cell}. The unit cells near the boundaries are given an offset of $a/10$, to avoid ambiguity of these particle locations.

The particles are given an initial velocity with Maxwell distribution, $ $. The distribution can be rewritten to: [[see JMT for full derivation]]

    U(r) = 4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^6\right].
