\section{Time evolution}
The numerical time integration of the equations of motion for the system is done by a Velocity Verlet algorithm. The Velocity Verlet algorithm was chosen for its simplicity of implementation, relative low error order (locally $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ and globally $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$) and ease of having the velocity and position at each timestep (unlike the leapfrog method).
